## Description

We present this package, InstaR, that performs digital image processing. It encompasses functions ranging from transformations like a simple flip, playing with color hues (rgb2gray) to 2D convolutions using a simple kernel matrix to do some interesting things! We have started with quite basic but diverse functions and hope to advance and add more with time.

## flip function
This is a transformation function which flips the image either horizontally or vertically.

``flip(img_path,direction,output_path```

Aruguments:

```img_path```: path to input image
```direction```: direction of flip. "h" (horizontal) or "v"(vertical)
```output_path```: path to output image

Example: ```flip("./img.jpg", "h","./img_flip.jpg")```
